## 🌊 Our Mission & Focus

SRC operates at the intersection of **Science · Education · Conservation**:

- **Science:** Conducting applied research on shark and ray ecology, biology, and conservation in highly human-impacted environments. Projects include GPS tagging (“GPS for Sharks”), urban shark ecology, immune system health, fish stress, reproduction, and climate change impacts.  
- **Education & Outreach:** Engaging **over 12,000 citizen scientists**, including school students, in field experiences. Offering **school group trips**, **FINS: For Girls in STEM** programs, and online resources like blogs and curricula.
- **Conservation Impact:** Advancing understanding of environmental change on shark behavior and health, and translating findings into effective conservation strategies.
